# trivia-train

A game show and trivia training app for people who want to win.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication powered by Clerk with support for email, username/password, phone number, Google, and X (Twitter)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with collapsible navigation
- **Training Modes**: Three different training types to improve your trivia skills
  - ⚡ Speed Training: Rapid-fire questions for quick thinking
  - 🎯 Accuracy Training: Focus on precision and correctness
  - 📚 Category Training: Master specific trivia categories

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with TypeScript
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (v4)
- **Authentication**: Clerk (email, username/password, phone, Google, X)

> **Note:** The project still includes `bcrypt` and `jsonwebtoken` dependencies for backward compatibility with legacy auth routes. These can be removed in a future update once all users have migrated to Clerk.

## Getting Started

### Tailwind note

This project uses Tailwind v4. Global styles are loaded via `@import "tailwindcss";` in `app/globals.css` (not the older `@tailwind base/components/utilities` directives).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bensultan1985/trivia-train.git
cd trivia-train
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/trivia_train"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"  # Required for trivia generation

# Clerk authentication keys (get these from https://clerk.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-clerk-publishable-key"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your-clerk-secret-key"
```

4. Set up the database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Schema

The app includes models for:

- **User**: User accounts with email, username, and encrypted passwords
- **Session**: Authentication session management
- **TriviaQuestion**: Questions with multiple choice answers and categories
- **TrainingSession**: Track user training progress and scores
