                About the Creator
              </h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Trivia Train was created by a two-time game show winner with a
                passion for competitive trivia and game strategy. Through
                personal experience competing on national television, the
                creator developed insights into what it takes to succeed on game
                shows—from the audition process to on-stage performance under
                pressure.

                With a deep interest in game theory, preparation techniques, and
                the psychology of competition, this platform brings together
                years of research and firsthand experience. The goal is to help
                others who share the dream of appearing on game shows by
                providing structured training, strategic insights, and a
                supportive community.
